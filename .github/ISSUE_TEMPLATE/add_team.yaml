        We are the interface between the Tree of Life teams (assembly production and faculty research) and Sanger’s IT teams, working together with the informatics teams of the other programmes. The work involves a wide range of scientific fields and technologies such as assembly methods, genomics, comparative genomics, cloud computing, large-scale analyses, with a strong emphasis on metadata tracking, quality controls, and event recording.
