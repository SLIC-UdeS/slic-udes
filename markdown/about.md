## Contributors {#contributors}
nf-core is by design a collaborative effort, and would not exist if it were not for the efforts of many dedicated contributors. You can see a list of nf-core members on GitHub: https://github.com/orgs/nf-core/people

Some of the organisations running nf-core pipelines are listed below, along with a key person who you can contact for advice.

## History {#history}
The nf-core project came about at the start of 2018 as the pet-project of [Phil Ewels](http://phil.ewels.co.uk/) ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)). He's the head of the development facility at [NGI Stockholm](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/) (National Genomics Infrastructure), part of [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/) in Sweden.

The NGI has been developing analysis pipelines for use with it's genomics data for several years and started using a set of standards for each pipeline created. This helped other people run the pipelines on their own systems - typically Swedish research groups at first, but later on other core genomics facilities too.

As the number of people interested in these common pipelines grew, it seemed silly to keep all the pipelines under the umbrella of just SciLifeLab, complete with NGI prefixes and logos. To try to open up the effort into a truly collaborative project, [nf-core](https://github.com/nf-core) was created and all relevant pipelines moved to this new GitHub Organisation.
