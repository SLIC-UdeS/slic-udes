## Safety team {#safety}

The safety team is responsible for ensuring the community is a safe place and responding to instances of misconduct. It is made up of community members who have displayed integrity, strong communication, and a genuine concern for community welfare, and members are not a part of the core team.

The current safety team in 2023 are:

- [@ctuni](https://t.co/mQInuSXc5R) Cris Tuñí
- [@heuerm](https://github.com/heuermh) Michael Heuer
- [@snafees](https://github.com/snafees/) Saba Nafees

## Financial Support

The vast majority of nf-core development is done as a labour of love, on a voluntary basis.
Most of all, we would like to thank all contributors (and their employers!).
You form the lifeblood of nf-core and we are eternally grateful for your time and efforts.

A number of projects and grants list nf-core as collaborators and also contribute to our community (see [_Projects we are involved with_](/community#initiatives)).
If you work with a project that would benefit from an explicit link with nf-core, please let us know.

Finally, we would specifically like to acknowledge and thank the following sponsors who help to support the project:

### Chan Zuckerberg Initiative {#czi-eoss}

<img src="/assets/img/contributors-colour/CZI.svg" alt="Chan Zuckerberg Initiative" class="float-end darkmode-image me-5 mb-5 w-25 ms-3">

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) is a great supporter of scientific open-source software.
We are very grateful to them for supporting nf-core and [Nextflow](https://nextflow.io/) with several grants through their _Essential Open Source Software for Science_ (EOSS) grants:

- [EOSS - second round](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/nextflow-and-nf-core/)
- [EOSS - fourth round](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/nextflow-and-nf-core-reproducible-workflows-for-the-scientific-community-cycle-4/)
- [EOSS - Diversity & Inclusion](https://cziscience.medium.com/advancing-diversity-and-inclusion-in-scientific-open-source-eaabe6a5488b)

Amongst other things, the CZI EOSS grant money has enabled the nf-core community to:

- Hire a dedicated coordinator / safety officer (50%)
- Hire a dedicated developer for nf-core (50%)
- Cover operational costs, such as our Slack subscription fees
- Organise events, such as hackathons
- Run organised mentorship programmes
- Hiring local community advocates from geographical areas where we currently lack representation

The CZI grant employs personnel based at the [SciLifeLab National Genomics Infrastructure](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/), the [Quantitative Biology Center](http://qbic.life/) in Tübingen Germany, and [Seqera Labs](https://seqera.io/).

### SciLifeLab Data Centre

<img src="/assets/img/contributors-colour/SciLifeLabDC.svg" alt="SciLifeLab Data Centre" class="float-end darkmode-image me-5 mb-5 w-25 ms-3">

The [SciLifeLab Data Centre](https://www.scilifelab.se/data/) supports nf-core with funding from the [SciLifeLab & Wallenberg National Program for Data-Driven Life Science](https://www.scilifelab.se/data-driven/).
This funding covers a full-time position ([@mashehu](https://github.com/mashehu), Matthias Hörtenhuber) to work on maintainance of nf-core framework code. For example, the [nf-core website](https://nf-co.re/) and the [nf-core/tools package](https://github.com/nf-core/tools/).

### Amazon Web Services {#aws}

<img src="/assets/img/contributors-colour/aws.svg" alt="Amazon Web Services" class="float-end darkmode-image me-5 mb-5 w-25 ms-3" style="max-width: 200px">

Amazon Web Services (AWS) kindly support nf-core with cloud compute credits to run each nf-core analysis pipeline with full-size benchmark datasets on every release.
You can explore and download these pipeline results under the <em class="mx-2"><i class="fab fa-aws me-2"></i> Results</em> tab on each pipeline page.

AWS also hosts the [AWS-iGenomes](https://registry.opendata.aws/aws-igenomes/) resource on the [Registry of Open Data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/).
This is used by most nf-core pipelines to give free and open access to the reference genomes of over 30 species, by using a simple `--genome` key when running a pipeline.

### Microsoft Azure

<img src="/assets/img/contributors-colour/azure.svg" alt="Microsoft Azure" class="float-end darkmode-image me-5 mb-5 w-25 ms-3" style="max-width: 200px">

Microsoft Azure also kindly supports nf-core with cloud compute credits to run each nf-core analysis pipeline with full-size benchmark datasets on every release.
You will soon be able to explore and download these pipeline results on the nf-core website, on each pipeline page.

## History of nf-core

The nf-core project came about at the start of 2018. [Phil Ewels](http://phil.ewels.co.uk/) ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)) was the head of the development facility at [NGI Stockholm](https://ngisweden.scilifelab.se/) (National Genomics Infrastructure), part of [SciLifeLab](https://www.scilifelab.se/) in Sweden.

The NGI had been developing analysis pipelines for use with it's genomics data for several years and started using a set of standards for each pipeline created. This helped other people run the pipelines on their own systems; typically Swedish research groups at first, but later on other groups and core genomics facilities too such as [QBIC](http://qbic.life/) in Tübingen.

As the number of users and contributors grew, the pipelines began to outgrow the SciLifeLab and NGI branding. To try to open up the effort into a truly collaborative project, [nf-core](https://github.com/nf-core) was created and all relevant pipelines moved to this new GitHub Organisation.

The early days of nf-core were greatly shaped by [Alex Peltzer](https://apeltzer.github.io/) ([@apeltzer](https://github.com/apeltzer/)), [Sven Fillinger](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/research-infrastructure/quantitative-biology-center-qbic/team0/sven-fillinger/) ([@sven1103](https://github.com/sven1103/)) and [Andreas Wilm](https://andreas-wilm.github.io/) ([@andreas-wilm](https://github.com/andreas-wilm/)).
Without them, the project would not exist.
