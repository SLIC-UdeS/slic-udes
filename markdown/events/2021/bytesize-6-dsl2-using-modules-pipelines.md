# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for an episode of our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize 6: DSL2 - Using modules in a pipeline

This week, Friederike Hanssen ([@friederikehanssen](http://github.com/friederikehanssen/)) will present: _**DSL2 - Using modules in a pipeline.**_
Kevin Menden ([@KevinMenden](http://github.com/KevinMenden/))
will follow with a presentation on: _**Adding modules to nf-core**_

The first talk will describe how to use DSL2 modules when writing an nf-core pipeline - both custom (`local`) modules, centralised from nf-core/modules and subworkflow files. The second talk will go to the details on how to add new modules to the nf-core/modules repository and provide module tests.
