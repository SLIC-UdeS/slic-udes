# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines as well as other general topics related to nf-core.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize 37: Gather Town

This week, James Fellows Yates ([@jfy133](http://github.com/jfy133/)) will present: _**Gather Town**_

This is the platform that we have used for recent online events, and that we will use again for the upcoming hackathon.

He'll do a full walk through of how to sign up, and, well - walk through the event!
