# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize 40: Code linting

This week, Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)) will present: _**Code linting tools**_

Code linting tools are now an essential part of the nf-core development framework, and once you're set up they're super easy to use.
Phil will tell us how to use Prettier to make your code, well, Prettier!
