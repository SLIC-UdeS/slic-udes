# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: Bactopia & using nf-core components in non-nf-core pipelines

This week, Robert A. Petit III ([@rpetit3](https://github.com/rpetit3)) will introduce us to his pipeline [Bactopia](https://github.com/bactopia/bactopia). A first for bytesize, bactopia is not an nf-core pipeline but is rather [influenced by nf-core](https://bactopia.github.io/acknowledgements/#nf-core).

Robert will show us the pipeline and explain how he is using nf-core components (such as [modules](https://nf-co.re/modules)) in this pipeline, despite it being outside the main nf-core organisation.
