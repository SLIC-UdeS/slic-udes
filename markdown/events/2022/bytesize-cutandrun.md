# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: cutandrun

This week, Chris Cheshire ([@chris-cheshire](https://github.com/chris-cheshire/)) will present: _**nf-core/cutandrun**_

Chris is going to give an overview and highlight the new features in the recent release of nf-core/cutandrun. Nf-core/cutand run is a pipeline for CUT&Run and CUT&Tag experimental protocols that where developed to study protein-DNA interactions and epigenomic profiling.
