# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **‚Äúnf-core/bytesize‚Äù**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: The Nextflow and nf-core community survey

At the start of 2022, nf-core joined the Nextflow community to do a joint survey entitled _"The State of the Workflow 2022: Nextflow and nf-core community survey"_ (see the [announcement blog post](https://seqera.io/blog/the-state-of-the-workflow-the-2022-nextflow-and-nf-core-community-survey/)). This follows on from the [2021 edition](https://seqera.io/blog/state-of-nextflow-2021-results/) but with some additional questions, including some concerning nf-core community strength and engagement.

This week, Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)) will give an overview over the key results of the survey. If that's not enough excitement for you, Evan Floden ([@evanfloden](https://github.com/evanfloden) will wrap up with a live-draw to select the winners of the survey draw: one Apple Macbook Air M1 up for grabs alongiside ten sustainability-certified Seqera Labs merchandise packs.. ü§© üíö üíª üëï
