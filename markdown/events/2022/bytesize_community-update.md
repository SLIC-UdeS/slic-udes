# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core community updates

The nf-core core team recently met for their first ever retreat. A lot of topics were discussed, in this talk Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels)) will describe the key points and cover some of the future directions for the community.

- New organisational team structure
- Updates to guidelines, test-data and archiving policies
- Looking ahead:
  - Subworkflows
