# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: nf-core/airrflow

This week, Gisela Gabernet ([@ggabernet](https://github.com/ggabernet)) will talk about the newest developments in the nf-core/airrflow pipeline.
nf-core/airrflow is a bioinformatics best-practice pipeline to analyze B-cell or T-cell bulk repertoire sequencing data. It makes use of the [Immcantation](https://immcantation.readthedocs.io/) toolset and requires as input targeted amplicon sequencing data of the V, D, J and C regions of the B/T-cell receptor with multiplex PCR or 5' RACE protocol.
