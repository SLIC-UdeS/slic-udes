# Welcome

Join us from October 3-5, 2022 for the Nextflow and nf-core training event!

The training is entirely virtual and free and will cover the fundamentals of using Nextflow and nf-core. The training will offer something for all skill levels but will be especially useful for those who are new to Nextflow and the nf-core community, or if you are thinking about joining the [nf-core Hackathon](https://nf-co.re/events/2022/hackathon-october-2022) (October 10-12, 2022) for the first time.

# Schedule

The training will be held across three consecutive days in 2.5-hour sessions (including time for a small break and questions).

Because nf-core is a global community we are making the training geographically accessible and will be holding separate sessions for different timezones:

# Community Streaming Events

Community streaming events are a great way to engage with your local communities while participating in events remotely. By simply booking a room and gathering your colleagues you can create discussion and build your community while enjoying the training, nf-core Hackathon, and/or Nextflow Summit together.

If this is something you are interested in you can tell us about your plans using the link below. We will send you extra material to help you prepare and promote your local event. To get started we have a [poster](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wQDtrVUv1Lro5lZFmeyfaPgJUI2pmGojtL9tWlQiVyQ/edit) that you can download, edit, and share. We have also created a dedicated [`#community-stream-events`](https://nfcore.slack.com/archives/C03Q3RE0RJQ) Slack channel where you can ask questions and share information about your event.

Keep an eye out for others hosting community events in your area. We will be sharing information about community events and how to get in contact with hosts on our website.

You can add your community event using [this link](https://seqera.typeform.com/streaming-event).
