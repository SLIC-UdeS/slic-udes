## Governance

nf-core is committed to being an open, inclusive, productive, and open-source community.
Anyone interested in the project can join the community and contribute to the project.
All community members must comply with the Code of Conduct (CoC) at all times.

To help manage the project, nf-core has teams that are made up of community members that oversee core activities.
