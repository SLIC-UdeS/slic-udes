# nf-core tools

To help you get started with nf-core, we've put together a companion package, written in Python.

You can find this tool, plus complete documentation at [https://github.com/nf-core/tools](https://github.com/nf-core/tools)

## Installation

```
pip install nf-core
```

Alternatively, you can install the development version directly from GitHub:

```
pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/nf-core/tools.git
```

## <a name="create"></a>Create a pipeline from scratch
To create a pipeline from scrath, use the command `nf-core create`.

You should see an output like this:

```
$ nf-core create

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

Usage: nf-core create [OPTIONS]

  Create a new pipeline using the nf-core template

Options:
  -n, --name TEXT         The name of your new pipeline  [required]
  -d, --description TEXT  A short description of your pipeline  [required]
  --new-version TEXT      The initial version number to use
  --no-git                Do not initialise pipeline as new git repository
  -f, --force             Overwrite output directory if it already exists
  -o, --outdir TEXT       Output directory for new pipeline (default: pipeline
                          name)
  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

If you have already initialized a Git repository, you can pass the option flag `--no-git`. Otherwise,
nf-core tools will create a Git repository via `git init`. You still have to add remote tracking by yourself though.

One very important setup is the creation of a branch `TEMPLATE`, right after the initialisation
from the nf-core template. We will use this branch to keep pipelines in sync with future changes
in the template.

Please follow the [synchronisation](sync) description.


## Listing pipelines
To see available pipelines, use the command `nf-core list`

You should get output that looks something like this:

```
$ nf-core list

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'


Name               Version    Published    Last Pulled    Default local is latest release?
-----------------  ---------  -----------  -------------  ----------------------------------
nf-core/methylseq  1.0        2 days ago   2 days ago     No
nf-core/ExoSeq     dev        -            -              No
nf-core/RNAseq     dev        -            -              No
```

## Lint tests
If you're writing a new pipeline or modifying an existing one, you should run the nf-core lint tests locally before pushing any changes. These tests are run automatically using the Travis CI testing and must pass before pull-requests can be merged.

To run the tests, us the command `nf-core lint [path]`, where `[path]` is the path to your pipeline code. For example, if your current working directory is the pipeline:

```
$ nf-core lint .

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'

## Bumping version numbers
Changing the version number for a pipeline is a little tedious and mistakes are easily made. To make this a little faster and simpler, there is a command `nf-core release [path] [version]`. For example:

This command runs the lint tests first, to ensure that the existing code meets the expected criteria, before trying to replace exiting variables.

```
$ nf-core release . 1.4

                                          ,--./,-.
          ___     __   __   __   ___     /,-._.--~\
    |\ | |__  __ /  ` /  \ |__) |__         }  {
    | \| |       \__, \__/ |  \ |___     \`-._,-`-,
                                          `._,._,'
