GoaT - Genomes on a Tree is built using [GenomeHubs 2.0](https://github.com/genomehubs/genomehubs) to present genome-relevant metadata for all Eukaryotic taxa across the tree of life. GoaT uses the [NCBI Taxonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/taxonomy) as the default backbone taxonomy, and adds synonyms from the following sources: [Open Tree of Life](https://tree.opentreeoflife.org/opentree/opentree13.4@ott304358/Eukaryota), [GBIF](https://www.gbif.org/species/search), and [IRMNG](https://www.irmng.org/index.php). Alternative backbone taxonomies will be implemented in the near future. Metadata in GoaT include, genome assembly attributes, genome sizes, C values, and chromosome numbers from [multiple sources](https://goat.genomehubs.org/sources).

**Queries of Genome-Relevant Metadata** – Use GoaT's [search](https://goat.genomehubs.org/search) to access direct and estimate values for any Eukaryote.

**Access Earth Biogenome Project Network Progress Reports** – Use GoaT's [project-dedicated pages](https://goat.genomehubs.org/projects) to see and download sequencing status and reports of Earth Biogenome Project Affiliated Projects.
