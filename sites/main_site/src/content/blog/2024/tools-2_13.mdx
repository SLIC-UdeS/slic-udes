This release contains some template changes and bug fixes.

# Highlights

We refactored the pipelines template a bit:

-   The `lib` directory is removed: :wave: Groovy code
-   Instead we now use nf-core subworkflows for pipeline initialisation
    -   Some nf-core pipelines adopted this already: [nf-core/fetchngs](https://github.com/nf-core/fetchngs/tree/dev) and [nf-core/rnaseq](https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/tree/dev)
-   The [`nf-validation` plugin](https://nextflow-io.github.io/nf-validation/1.1/) is now used to create an input channel from a sample sheet file.

## Additional bug fixes and improvements

-   Have you seen a `no space left on device` error or your CI tests lately? This is now fixed by adding a clean up step in the github actions.

-   [New api-docs](https://nf-co.re/tools/docs/latest) on the nf-core website to get clarifications on linting errors etc.

-   Updating a module wonâ€™t remove custom nextflow.config files anymore.

-   The commands `nf-core modules test` and `nf-core subworkflows test` now have a new parameter `--profile` to specify the container to run nf-test with.

Thanks to all the contributors who made this release possible, especially to [Harshil Patel](https://github.com/drpatelh/) and his team for kicking off the `lib` restructuring and the `utils_*` subworkflows.
