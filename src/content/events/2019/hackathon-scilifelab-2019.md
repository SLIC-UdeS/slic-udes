Informal meetup for anyone interested in learning more about nf-core and Nextflow.
Join to work on your own pipeline, existing pipeline issues, supporting code or just to
give yourself some dedicated time to get to grips with the Nextflow ecosystem.
Everyone is welcome to join, even if it's just for a couple of hours.

The hackathon will be in Milky Way and Andromeda, Alfa 2 in SciLifeLab Stockholm.
If you need access to the building, please get in touch with Phil.

This event is being organised by Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels), [phil.ewels@scilifelab.se](mailto:phil.ewels@scilifelab.se)).
