# nf-core/bytesize

Join us for our **weekly series** of short talks: **“nf-core/bytesize”**.

Just **15 minutes** + questions, we will be focussing on topics about using and developing nf-core pipelines.
These will be recorded and made available at <https://nf-co.re>
It is our hope that these talks / videos will build an archive of training material that can complement our documentation. Got an idea for a talk? Let us know on the [`#bytesize`](https://nfcore.slack.com/channels/bytesize) Slack channel!

## Bytesize: Using nf-core configs in custom pipelines

One of our first bytesize talks described the use of nf-core configs in the context of nf-core pipelines (you can find it here on [youtube](https://youtu.be/cXBYusdjrc0)). In an extension to this previous talk, today Judith ([@jbv2](https://github.com/jbv2)) will explain how nf-core configs can be used in custom Nextflow pipelines.
