Join us on **April 17** for the first meeting of the _#animal-genomics_ special interest group!

For this inauguration, we are honored to announce Christa Kühn, president of the Friedrich Loeffler Institute, BovReg project coordinator and former coordinator of EuroFAANG RI, as the speaker. Christa is well-known in the Bovine field for her important contributions to animal genetics. Her talk will be followed by a round table where the structure of the series will be announced and discussed with the participants.
