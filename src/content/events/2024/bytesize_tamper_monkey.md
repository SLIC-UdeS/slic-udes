This week Phil Ewels ([@ewels](https://github.com/ewels/)) will show us how to modify any website using the [Tamper Monkey browser plugin](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

The rough outline of the talk will be:

- Showing how the browser developer console can be used to understand how web pages are built
- Editing a live web page locally in the developer console
- A walk through of writing a custom Tamper Monkey userscript from scratch to modify how a given web page renders
- How to horrify your coworkers by messing with their browser whilst they go for a coffee
