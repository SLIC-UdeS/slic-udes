# Welcome

Join us in person for the May 2024 nf-core hackathon!

This hackathon will be held in advance of the _**Nextflow Summit 2024**_ in Boston, America ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸.
You can find out more information about the summit at https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/boston/.

The Boston nf-core hackathon will be in-person only, without the hybrid / online features that we have used in other events (e.g., Gather Town).
Anyone is free to join remotely, as we will be using the same GitHub Project boards and Slack communication as usual.
However, please be aware, we won't actively be trying to run this as a hybrid event.

:::warning{.fa-graduation-cap}
This hackathon is not a training event and is aimed at people that already have an understanding of Nextflow and/or nf-core.
If you're interested in learning how to use Nextflow and nf-core, there is a small [in-person training](https://summit.nextflow.io/2024/boston/training/) being held held at the time as the hackathon.
Please note that the training event requires a ticket to attend.
