# Introduction

Meta-omics methods aim to simultaneously analyse the entire multi-species potential and realised functional capacity of a biological sample. In other words to taxonomically and functionally characterise all organisms and their activity in a community.

The initial aims of this interest group will be:
1) helping coordinate compatibility between existing and potential meta-omic nf-core pipelines
2) implementing semi-'chaining' of sequential pipelines
3) developing standard parameters for different sub-disciplines (i.e. microbiome analysis) for each pipeline
4) documenting usage of 'first level' meta-omic pipelines followed by complementary analyses with "secondary" pipelines such as #funcscan, #phageannotator, #phyloplace, #rnaseq, #differentialabundance etc.

Depending on interst/activity, other potential activities could include:
1) benchmarking meta-omic pipelines using relevant datasets (i.e. CAMI2), or reads generated using #readsimulator
2) adding nf-tests to meta-omic pipelines
3) reducing functional redundancy between pipelines

# Activities

When were we thinking of having meetings?
Are these going to be development meetings, or planning meetings?
What platform should we post meetings on?
Should we create a project board that we can post tasks on?
