    <h1>Welcome to the nf-core shop!</h1>
    <p class="mt-3 mb-4">
        We are excited to announce the launch of the nf-core shop! We have a range of products available, including
        t-shirts, hoodies, mugs, and stickers. All products are printed and shipped by our partners at Spreadshirt.
        Before you go in, make sure you're aware of some FAQ:

                <h5>How does this work?</h5>
                <p class="card-text small">
                    When you buy something, Spreadshirt will print and ship the product to you. This means we don't have
                    to hold any inventory in stock, or really do anything. The entire shop runs directly with
                    Spreadshirt.

                <h5>Does nf-core make a profit?</h5>
                <p class="card-text small">
                    No, we have set the profit margin to zero, everything is at cost price. This means everything is as
                    cheap as possible, and also saves us from having to navigate legal / tax headaches.

                <h5>What about shipping?</h5>
                <p class="card-text small">
                    There are two shops, one in the US and one in the EU. Plus, many locales. Pick the one closest to
                    you to use your local currency and get the best shipping.
